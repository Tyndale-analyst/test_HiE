A long time ago, in a land called Buk-bu-yeo, there was a man named Hae Mo-su.
He was the son of the Sky God. He sometimes came down from the sky to play.

One day, he saw three daughters of Ha-baek, the River God.
They were very beautiful.
Hae Mo-su wanted to marry one of them.
But the daughters ran away.
So Hae Mo-su made a plan and caught the oldest daughter.
Her name was Yu-hwa.

He asked Ha-baek to let him marry Yu-hwa.
Ha-baek saw that Hae Mo-su was very strong and special.
So he said yes.
But the next day, Hae Mo-su went back to the sky and left Yu-hwa alone.
Ha-baek became very angry.
He sent Yu-hwa away to a far land called Ubal-su, ruled by King Geum-wa.

One day, a fisherman found Yu-hwa in the river. He took her to King Geum-wa.
After hearing her story, the king kept her in a small palace.

One morning, sunlight touched Yu-hwa’s body.
Then she became pregnant.
After 10 months, she gave birth to a big egg from her left side.
King Geum-wa was shocked.
“An egg from a human? This is bad luck,” he said.
So he told people to throw it away.

But animals protected the egg. It did not break.
So the king gave the egg back to Yu-hwa.
She kept it warm.
Soon, the egg broke, and a baby boy came out.

The boy was very smart.
After one month, he said, “Mother, I cannot sleep because of the flies.
Please make me a bow and arrows.”
Yu-hwa made them, and the boy shot every fly.
He never missed.
So they called him Ju-mong, which means "good archer" or "great with a bow."

Ju-mong grew up strong and smart.
King Geum-wa’s seven sons were jealous of him.
Ju-mong said to his mother, “I want to go south and build my own country.
But I cannot leave you.”

Yu-hwa gave him a good horse and some seeds.
“Go and live well,” she said.

Ju-mong left with three friends: O-i, Ma-ri, and Hyeop-bo.
Soon, they came to a big river.
But soldiers were chasing them.
Ju-mong looked at the sky and prayed:

“I am the son of the Sky God and the River God.
Please help me cross.”

Then, many fish and turtles came and made a bridge.
Ju-mong and his friends crossed safely.

Ju-mong reached a place called Jol-bon.
He made it his capital city.
There, he became a king.
He named his new country Go-gu-ryeo.

The local leader, Yeon Ta-bal, gave his daughter So Seo-no to Ju-mong as his wife.
Ju-mong also won a battle against a nearby kingdom called Bi-ryu-guk and made it part of Go-gu-ryeo.

When Ju-mong was 40 years old, he went up to the sky and never came back.
People held a funeral with his whip.
Then they built a shrine and gave him honor every year.
